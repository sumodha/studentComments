# studentComments

Hello! This project was created to make the process of writing student comments quicker and more efficient. 

Once the program finishes running, it stores all information in a file. All comments can then be copy and pasted to the spreadsheet. 

In retrospect, the program was not that beneficial to me because I had very few students in my class, but it definitely was a great help to those with larger class sizes.

Skills Learned: 
- how to create and write to files
